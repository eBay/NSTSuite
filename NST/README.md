# NST
Network Service Test (NST) Framework for contract testing and generating mocks.

NST supports contract testing of both REST and GraphQL services using OpenAPI (3.0) and GraphQL schemas respectively. In addition to contract testing NST supports writing verified requests and responses to HTTP archives (har) files for use as mocks. NST may also write UI automation from the NST to UI mapping definitions you provide.

NST may be run, without writing mocks or test code generation, to verify the mocks produced are not stale. If your NST tests are passing then you may proceed with confidence (relative to the diligence of your NST test validations) that your mocks are not stale.

The output format of the mocks and service client may be overridden for customizations required by your organization.

See REST and GraphQL examples in the test packages:  

* [REST](../NSTTutorials)
* [GraphQL](../NSTTutorials/GraphQLExamples/src/main/java/com/ebay/nst/tutorials/graphql)

NST has test runner hooks for TestNG so please plan to adopt TestNG for your tests.

## Adding NST to Your Project
NST is deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:nstest). The artifact ID is `nstest`. The latest release versions are shown under the project releases, or you may check Maven Central.

## Running Locally
NST is setup to sign the jar for deployment. Include `-Dgpg.skip=true` in your mvn command to avoid the password prompt.

## Tutorials - Videos

This video sequence walks you through the NST, what it is, how to begin using it and examples. If you are new to NST please start at the beginning with the first video (NST Overview) and continue in sequence. You can always come back and reference videos out-of-sequence to refresh yourself on specific details of NST.

## Runtime Arguments
Example usage: `-DtestExeEnv=QA`

| VM Parameters<br/>(`-D<parameter>`) | Required/Optional | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `testExeEnv` | Optional | Set the target environment.<br/><br/>Options: PROD, QA, FEATURE.<br/><br/>Default: QA. |
| `schemavalidation` | Optional | Set to `false` to turn off schema validation of service calls. This is on by default for any service wrapper that includes a schema file. |
| `nstplatform` | Optional | Set the platform to execute the calls as (IOS, ANDROID).<br/><br/>Default: IOS. |
| `whatToWrite` | Optional | Turn on or off writing of tests and mocks.<br/><br/>Options:<br/>TESTS : Generate UI test code<br/>MOCKS : Generate mocks<br/>NONE : Don't generate anything<br/><br/>Default: NONE.<br/><br/>You may chain the values using \| character. Example: <pre>-DwhatToWrite=TESTS\|MOCKS</pre> |
| `androidMocksLocation` | Optional | Location to write the Android mocks to (InterceptorFlowRule, JSON mock payloads). Only applies if whatToWrite is set to MOCKS and nstplatform is set to ANDROID.<br/><br/>Default: current working directory. |
| `iosMocksLocation` | Optional | Location to write the iOS log files to (HAR file mock request/response). Only applies if whatToWrite is set to MOCKS and nstplatform is set to IOS.<br/><br/>Default: current working directory. |
| `androidTestsLocation` | Optional | Location of the Android UI test classes. . Only applies if whatToWrite is set to TESTS and nstplatform is set to ANDROID. If not specified no Android UI test code will be generated. |
| `iosTestsLocation` | Optional | Location of the iOS UI test classes. Only applies if whatToWrite is set to TESTS and nstplatform is set to IOS. If not specified no iOS UI test code will be generated. |
| `disableLogToConsole` | Optional | List of logging attributes to disable. Separate each value with the \| character, EG: <pre><pre>-DdisableLogToConsole=RESPONSE_PAYLOAD\|SERVICE_CONFIG</pre>Supported values: <ul><li>RESPONSE_PAYLOAD: Disable logging of all response payloads.</li><li>SERVICE_CONFIG: Disable logging of service configuration.</li></ul> |
| `customLoggersPackage` | Optional | Specify the package containing custom loggers. This includes loggers for writing mocks and for generating UI test code. By default, the system will write HTTP archive (HAR) files. If you wish to add platform specific logging of mocks, other than HAR files, you may implement FormatWriter.java and reference the package containing your implementation with this parameter. There is a default package for the custom loggers to be placed in, which is `com.ebay.custom.loggers`. You can either use this package or specify your own for your custom loggers. For more information, please see the Custom Loggers tutorial [here](../NSTTutorials/MockGeneration/README.md#adding-a-custom-logger-to-modify-output).<br/><br/>Example: <pre>-DpackageWithCustomLoggers=com.ebay.custom.loggers</pre> <br>Default: `com.ebay.custom.loggers` |
| `useNstDefaultMockLogger` | Optional | There may be a need, however rare, to switch between the default NST logger for the respective platform and a custom logger provided by your organization. Setting this to `true` will force the use of NST's default logger for the respective platform. `False` will use the custom logger, if provided, and fallback to the default one if a custom logger is NOT provided.</br></br>**This runtime argument MAY NOT be overridden at the test level.**</br></br>Default: `false` 

Your log file name will be `<test class name>_<test method name>_<ordered index>_<api wrapper name>.har`.

Example usage: `-DwhatToWrite=MOCKS -DandroidMocksLocation=/Users/bob/Desktop`

You may also define these runtime arguments in your pom via the `argLine` tag when defining your maven surefire plugin configuration. This is ideal as you can setup your arguments once and everyone can use the same configuration when running the tests.

```xml
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${maven.surefire.plugin.version}</version>
                <configuration>
                    <suiteXmlFiles>
                        <suiteXmlFile>${project.basedir}/src/test/java/com/ebay/testConfig.xml
                        </suiteXmlFile>
                    </suiteXmlFiles>
                    <argLine>
                        -Dschemavalidation=true
                        -DwhatToWrite=NONE
                        -DandroidTestsLocation=../andr_core/pathToFuiTests
                        -DandroidMocksLocation=../andr_core/pathToIosMocks
                        -DiosTestsLocation=../ios_core/pathToFuiTests
                        -DiosMocksLocation=../ios_core/pathToIosMocks
                        -DclientVersion=${nst.client.version}
                        -Dsite=US
                        -Dnstplatform=ANDROID
                    </argLine>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
```

## OpenAPI Schema Validation - Additional Properties

By default, the OpenAPI validator allows responses to contain attributes which are not defined in the contract. This behavior may be disabled by setting
`allowAdditionalProperties(AllowAdditionalProperties.NO)`.

```
// NstRequestType requestType = ...
OpenApiSchemaValidator validator = new OpenApiSchemaValidator.Builder("contract.yaml", "/path", requestType)
    .allowAdditionalProperties(AllowAdditionalProperties.NO)
    .build();
```

Please note, disallowing additional properties will cause schemas with `allOf` to be inlined in the generated JSON Schema, thus validation failures for
required fields will not describe which part of the composite model carries the required attribute(s).

## GraphQL Support
Follow the steps below to start using NST for GraphQL contract testing.

1) Have your service wrapper extend ServiceWrapperGraphQLBase. Define the abstract methods for GraphQL schema file, type and name to enable schema validation against responses.
2) Either extend ServiceWrapperGraphQLRequest or have a factory for generating your GraphQL requests that returns ServiceWrapperGraphQLRequest (you MUST specify the `query` value). This model defines the payload you will send to the GraphQL endpoint.

Use the service wrapper to call the GraphQL endpoint. If your GraphQL schema is defined the GraphQL schema validator will be used to evaluate the response. Use the TMBuilder's thin model classes to finish up your tests. Enjoy!
